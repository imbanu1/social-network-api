AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
![alt text](images/modb.png)
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

![alt text](images/dbth.png)
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
![alt text](<images/all thoughts.png>)
![alt text](<images/all users.png>)
![alt text](images/thoughts.png)
![alt text](images/users.png)
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
